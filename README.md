# end2end_realistic_predictors

This repo constains the tensorflow implementation for an end-to-end trainable improvement for the paper [Towards Realistic Predictors](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ECCV_2018/papers/Pei_Wang_Towards_Realistic_Predictors_ECCV_2018_paper.pdf) on ECCV2018.

## Disclaimer
By now, the codes are dirty, which only were tested on several small scale datasets. The corresponding paper will be released soon.
